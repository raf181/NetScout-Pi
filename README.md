## üì• Installation

### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card
2. Enable SSH by creating an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition
3. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and power it on
4. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH: `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`
5. Download and run the setup script:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raf181/NetScout-Pi/main/scripts/setup.sh | sudo bash
    ```

6. After the installation is complete, the Raspberry Pi will reboot
7. Connect to the `NetProbe` WiFi network (password: `netprobe123`)
8. Access the dashboard at http://netprobe.local
9. Set your admin password during the first login

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card
2. Boot your Raspberry Pi and log in
3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raf181/NetScout-Pi.git
    cd NetScout-Pi
    ```

4. Run the installation script:

    ```bash
    sudo bash scripts/install.sh
    ```

5. Set up network interfaces:

    ```bash
    sudo bash scripts/setup.sh
    ```

6. Reboot your Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

7. Connect to the `NetProbe` WiFi network and access the dashboard

### Note on GitHub Authentication

GitHub no longer supports password authentication for git operations. The scripts are designed to handle this automatically by using alternative methods if direct cloning fails. If you're manually cloning the repository, please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL.md) for detailed authentication options.
